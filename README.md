# mfe-container
The main container of the MFE project (mfe stands for micro front-ends, get it? 😉). It's just a small project for the sole purpose of learning micro front-ends.

It's supposed to be integrated with the other three repositories, mfe-marketing (the marketing part), mfe-auth (responsible for authentication) and mfe-dashboard (basically a dashboard 🤷‍♂️).
